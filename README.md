# Manual Document:

## To utilize this application, follow these steps:

1. Initiate the process by running the tracker.py file.

2. Launch all necessary peers (this application is designed to operate with three peers). If needed, you can add more peers by duplicating the peer code and modifying the id and port. Don't forget to establish a repository for each new peer.

3. Upon running the peers or client, a dialog box will appear prompting you to select the peer's directory. It's crucial to select the appropriate folder, as this application lacks error handling for cancellations or selections outside of the 'main' folder.

4. Import the torrent file you wish to download.
5. Patiently wait for the download to complete successfully.


## To generate a new torrent file for new files, follow these steps:

1. Execute create_torrent.py.
2. Import the files you wish to convert into a torrent file.
3. Assign a name to the torrent file and select a destination for its storage.
